abstract: >-
  The FAIRDOM-SEEK platform is a web-based resource for
  sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets,models
  or simulations, processes and research outcomes. It
  preserves associations between them, along with
  information about the people and organisations involved.
  Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard
  format for describing how individual experiments are
  aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within
  SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow
  the structure to be used outside of Biology.
